**DDH-3D-Net** is a network designed for automatic localization of standard planes in 3D ultrasound images of neonatal hips. It further performs measurements on the localized 2D standard planes, aiding in the assessment of developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH).

The code and model will be available soon. Stay tuned for updates!
